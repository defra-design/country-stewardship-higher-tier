The RPA (Rural Payments Agency) is the organisation that incentivises farmers and land managers to deliver locally prioritised environmental benefits and facilitates join up of these benefits across holdings. Countryside stewardship is one of multiple services that enables itâ€™s users to apply for those incentives. 

The CS service has 2 tiers of for applicants to apply for, mid-tier and higher-tier. The mid-tier service went through a digital transformation and went live in March 2023. The next phase of the evolution of CS into CS+ will focus on the higher-tier journey. The higher-tier journey service needs to be live for the 2024 applicants. Therefore the initial transformation will focus on getting the current service digitised.
